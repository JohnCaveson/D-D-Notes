# [The Mariner](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/the-mariner-crookedmoon24.md)
*Source: The Crooked Moon (2024) p. 184*  

Shuffling through the car is a [Wayward Haint](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/wayward-haint-crookedmoon24.md) of an old man in a sailor's coat with a clay pipe. Grumbling, he purposelessly heaves sacks of mail from one end of the car to the other as if he was loading cargo on a ship. There is a distant regretful look in his eyes as he goes about his labor.

When encountered, he only cares to talk about the sea and his long career as a sailor, captain, and lighthouse keeper, bemoaning that he died inland. He regularly mentions that he wishes he could see the sea one last time with glum wistfulness.

Bringing the Mariner the landscape painting of the coastline, which can be found in the Lounge Car (area G3), fills him with a sense of awe and reverence. He sheds a tear and remarks on the beauty of the sea before breathing an unfettered sigh and fading away.

Alternatively, below are suggested resolution proficiencies:

- **Navigator's Tools or Survival.** Reminisce with the Mariner about times navigating dangerous waters.  
- **Performance or Musical Instrument.** Sing or play a lively shanty to lift his spirits.  
- **Deception or Medicine.** Opine about all the worst parts of sailing, including scurvy, drowning, and other miserable conditions, to help him let go.
